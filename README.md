# Data Science

# Project 1: Soccer Players' Rating (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/Soccer-players-rating)
- Used the data from European soccer database and built a regression model to predict the overall rating of a soccer player based on various attributes.
- Built a basic API using Flask and deployed it into GCP, Herolu and Pivotal cloud platforms.

# Project 2: Predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/blob/master/50K_classification.ipynb)
- Built several classification models to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year from the classic adult dataset. 
- Built KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost models and compared which of them best fits the data set by comparing the respective AUC and accuracy scores.

# Project 3: Review Scrapper 
- Using Python and Flask, built a basic text scrapper that fetches the reviews of customers from flipkart site for various products and deployed it in Heroku cloud platform.

# Project 4: Covid-19 Mask detection
- Implemented a small scale face-mask detection algorithm which detects people who are wearing masks, not wearing masks and wearing it incorrectly. 
- Used a rented GPU on #Paperspace with machine type: P4000 with memory:30 GB and power of 8 CPUS. On Top of that used the TensorFlow object detection API of Faster-RCNN
  InceptionV2 pre-trained on COCO.  The project still needs to be tuned with more training data such as lighting conditions and time of the day.
