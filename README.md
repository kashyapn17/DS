# Project 1: L&T Vehicle Loan Default Prediction (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/L%26T_Loan_Default)
- Financial institutions incur significant losses due to the default of vehicle loans. The need for a better credit risk scoring model is also raised by these institutions.
- The goal of the project is to accurately predict the probability of loanee/borrower defaulting on a vehicle loan in the first EMI (Equated Monthly Instalments) on the due   date.
- Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and important determinants can be identified which can be further used for minimising the default rates.
- Performed in depth EDA, handled the imbalanced dataset and built models to predict the same. Further, performed caliberation to get the exact probabilities of loan default.
- Key skills: EDA, SMOTE, Ensemble Approach (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking), Caliberation.

# Project 2: Donors Choose project approval (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/Donors_choose)
- The goal of the project is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. 
- Preprocessed the text data, performed various word embeddings, and built Naïve Bayes and GBDT models to predict the same.
- Key skills: Text Pre-processing, Word Embeddings (TFIDF, W2V), Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Boosting.

# Project 3: Zomato_EDA (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/EDA_Zomato)
- Did Extensive EDA on the Zomato India Restuarants Dataset. 
- The zomato exploratory data analysis is for the foodies to find the best restaurants, value for money restaurants in their locality. It also helps to find their required    cuisines in their locality.
- Key skills: EDA, Visualization.

# Project 4: Soccer Players' Rating (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/Soccer-players-rating)
- Used the data from European soccer database and built a regression model to predict the overall rating of a soccer player based on various attributes.
- Built a basic API using Flask and deployed it into GCP, Herolu and Pivotal cloud platforms.

# Project 5: Predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/blob/master/50K_classification.ipynb)
- Built several classification models to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year from the classic adult dataset. 
- Built KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost models and compared which of them best fits the data set by comparing the respective AUC and accuracy scores.
