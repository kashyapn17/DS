# Data Science

# Project 1: Donors Choose project approval (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/blob/master/Donors_choose/DonorsChoose.ipynb)
- The goal of the project is to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. 
- Pre-processed the text data using TFIDF, TDIDF-W2V and built Naive Bayes and GBDT(LightGBM) models to  classify whether the submitted project will be approved or not.

# Project 2: Zomato_EDA (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/blob/master/EDA_Zomato/EDA%20-%20Case%20Study%20-%20Zomato%20Dataset%20.ipynb)
- Did Extensive EDA on the Zomato India Restuarants Dataset. 
- The zomato exploratory data analysis is for the foodies to find the best restaurants, value for money restaurants in their locality. It also helps to find their required    cuisines in their locality.

# Project 3: Soccer Players' Rating (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/tree/master/Soccer-players-rating)
- Used the data from European soccer database and built a regression model to predict the overall rating of a soccer player based on various attributes.
- Built a basic API using Flask and deployed it into GCP, Herolu and Pivotal cloud platforms.

# Project 4: Predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year (https://github.com/kashyapn17/DS/blob/master/50K_classification.ipynb)
- Built several classification models to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year from the classic adult dataset. 
- Built KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost models and compared which of them best fits the data set by comparing the respective AUC and accuracy scores.
